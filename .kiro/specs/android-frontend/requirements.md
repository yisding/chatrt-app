# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a native Android frontend application for ChatRT that provides real-time voice and video communication with OpenAI's Realtime API. The Android app will complement the existing web-based frontend by offering a native mobile experience with enhanced performance, better device integration, and optimized mobile UI/UX patterns.

The Android app will maintain feature parity with the web frontend while leveraging Android-specific capabilities such as native camera/microphone access, background processing, and mobile-optimized UI components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to have voice conversations with the AI agent through a native Android app, so that I can access ChatRT functionality with better performance and mobile-optimized experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the Android app THEN the system SHALL display a clean, mobile-optimized interface with clear audio connection controls
2. WHEN the user taps the "Start Voice Chat" button THEN the system SHALL request microphone permissions and establish a WebRTC connection to the ChatRT backend
3. WHEN the WebRTC connection is established THEN the system SHALL display real-time connection status with visual indicators
4. WHEN the user speaks THEN the system SHALL capture audio through the device microphone and stream it to the OpenAI Realtime API
5. WHEN the AI responds THEN the system SHALL play the audio response through the device speakers or connected audio output
6. WHEN the user taps "End Chat" THEN the system SHALL gracefully close the WebRTC connection and return to the initial state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to share my camera feed during conversations with the AI agent, so that I can have visual interactions and get assistance with things I'm looking at.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects "Video Chat" mode THEN the system SHALL request camera permissions and display a camera preview
2. WHEN camera permissions are granted THEN the system SHALL show the front-facing camera feed by default with an option to switch to rear camera
3. WHEN the video chat starts THEN the system SHALL stream both audio and video to the ChatRT backend via WebRTC
4. WHEN the user taps the camera switch button THEN the system SHALL toggle between front and rear cameras without interrupting the connection
5. WHEN the user rotates the device THEN the system SHALL maintain proper video orientation and UI layout
6. IF camera permissions are denied THEN the system SHALL fall back to audio-only mode and display an appropriate message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to share my screen content with the AI agent, so that I can get help with apps, documents, or other content on my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects "Screen Share" mode THEN the system SHALL request screen recording permissions through Android's MediaProjection API
2. WHEN screen sharing permissions are granted THEN the system SHALL capture the device screen and stream it via WebRTC
3. WHEN screen sharing is active THEN the system SHALL display a persistent notification indicating active screen recording
4. WHEN the user navigates away from the app during screen sharing THEN the system SHALL continue streaming screen content in the background
5. WHEN the user ends screen sharing THEN the system SHALL stop screen capture and remove the notification
6. IF screen sharing permissions are denied THEN the system SHALL display an error message and offer alternative modes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to see real-time connection status and logging information, so that I can understand the state of my conversation and troubleshoot any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is connecting THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator with connection progress
2. WHEN the connection is established THEN the system SHALL show a green indicator and "Connected" status
3. WHEN there are connection issues THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages with suggested actions
4. WHEN the user enables debug mode THEN the system SHALL show real-time logs of WebRTC events and API calls
5. WHEN network conditions change THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust streaming quality and notify the user if needed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the app to handle Android-specific scenarios gracefully, so that I can use ChatRT reliably across different device states and configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app goes to background during a call THEN the system SHALL maintain the WebRTC connection and continue audio streaming
2. WHEN an incoming phone call occurs THEN the system SHALL pause the ChatRT session and resume after the call ends
3. WHEN the device battery is low THEN the system SHALL offer to reduce video quality or switch to audio-only mode
4. WHEN the user connects/disconnects headphones THEN the system SHALL automatically route audio to the appropriate output
5. WHEN the device orientation changes THEN the system SHALL adapt the UI layout while maintaining video aspect ratios
6. WHEN the app is killed by the system THEN the system SHALL properly clean up WebRTC connections and release resources

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to configure app settings and preferences, so that I can customize the ChatRT experience to my needs and device capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens settings THEN the system SHALL display options for default video mode, audio quality, and camera preferences
2. WHEN the user changes the default camera THEN the system SHALL remember this preference for future sessions
3. WHEN the user adjusts audio quality settings THEN the system SHALL apply changes to the WebRTC configuration
4. WHEN the user enables/disables debug logging THEN the system SHALL persist this setting across app restarts
5. WHEN the user configures server settings THEN the system SHALL validate the connection and save working configurations
