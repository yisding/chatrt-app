# hello-realtime

Hello Realtime is a complete OpenAI Realtime application that supports both WebRTC and SIP users.
You can access the app via WebRTC at https://hello-realtime.val.run, or via SIP by calling 425-800-0042.

This demo shows off the new SIP API, the new all-in-one WebRTC API, and the new server-side websocket interface.

If you remix the app, you'll just need to pop in your own OPENAI_API_KEY (from platform.openai.com), and also the OPENAI_SIGNING_SECRET if you want to use the SIP interface.
